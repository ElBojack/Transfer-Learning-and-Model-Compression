# Transfer-Learning-and-Model-Compression
In this assignment you will use transfer learning and the TFLite Converter/Interpreter to create a "traffic sign" classifier.

Download the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

Unzip the file in the root folder under a folder called "archive".

This is the structure of the archive folder:
archive/
  Train/
  Test/
  Meta/
  ....

You can now run:

```bash
python problem1.py
```
You can modify the number of epoch right inside the code. (Default: 2)


and

```bash
python problem2.py
```
You can directly run this script without running problem1.py since we provide a model already.
